# [Leo's notes ↗](https://graph.leolazou.com)

A personal website in the form of a graph of interconnected thoughts, ideas and information.
A place to share.
Only starting.
<br>
They call it a _digital garden_. A very beautiful name, but I prefer _graph_.

This repo builds and deploys the website. I've externalised the content into a separate private repo.
