# [Leo's notes ↗](https://graph.leolazou.com)

A personal website in the form of a graph of interconnected thoughts, ideas and information.
A place to share.
Only starting.
<br>
They call it a _digital garden_. A very beautiful name, but I prefer _graph_.

Tech:
This repo builds and deploys the website.
The content, an Obsidian vault, is in a separate private repo. Whenever the content is edited and pushed (on desktop or mobile), a build is tiggered and the website reflects the latest changes within a minute.
