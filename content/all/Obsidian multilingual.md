GitHub: [Obsidian Multilingual](https://github.com/leolazou/obsidian-multilingual)
# the idea:
- **the goal**l: a  plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) allowing users to more easily use the power of Obsidian in many languages
- **the idea**: translate the title of a page into select languages, and add these translations as aliases, either automatically on page creation/rename or with a command/button
- **the deeper goal**: better use Obsidian for thought for multilingual people.

# progress

- [x] MVP ready
- [x] v1.0.0:  published
- [ ] v1.1.0
	- [ ] from / main title language 
	- [ ] if entered name not in main language, set title to main language and add user-set title to aliases


## next features

- maybe 
	- languages validation
	- selecting a main title language (for users wishing a higher consistency in notes naming)
		- either to avoid language detection
		- or to translate to it if the title was typed in a different language
	- explanation of how to set up (get API key) on first use / in settings
