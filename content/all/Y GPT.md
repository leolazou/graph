#### initial thoughts
Looking at many presentations, articles, and otherwise documents bearing information, one can notice only some information comes in text. Accompanying the text, we often see tables, charts, graphs, and various infographics.

- Text: good when you need to transmit information where the concept of time is helpful (example: explaining more and more complex things; storytelling; manipulation; ...)
- Bullet points: good for listing, and, to a certain extent, for multi-level information
- Tables: good for numbers, or otherwise information that you might need to search or compare
- Charts: good for quickly conveying/understanding trends, comparisons, classification...
- Schemas: good for a visual representation of things that can be harder to explain in text
- Infographics: good for a quicker reading & understanding of simple information, often gives a high degree of freedom to the reader.

ChatGPT and other LLMs answer in text, lists (bullet points) and sometimes tables. Now, it can sometimes include charts. But never with great visuals, schemas, infographics.


#### the attempt
**Y** is an attempt to create a GPT that answers with infographics & visuals instead of text. This is possible thanks to Dall•E.

- techs at the time of creation:
	- GPT 4
	- Dall•E 3
- link to the GPT: [Y](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-n1HmQ965Z-y)

#### observation
ChatGPT and Dall•E, in its current versions, struggle to create meaningful visuals. Dall•E certainly knows how they should look, i.e. the result looks beautiful, but fails to draw images with actual information.
